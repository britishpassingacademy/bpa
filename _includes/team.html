Through his continued commitment to trips across to the United States of America visiting some of the top football programs, he has been able to connect with and develop a well-respected network of US coaches.<br /> <br />With these contacts, his coaching expertise has grown and he has become one of the most educated coaches in the UK at his position. This unique network of coaches has also opened the door to bring them across to be guest coaches with the BPA. </p>
